How This Works (Quick Guide)
1
No Setup Needed for Attack Tests
The purple "Attack Simulation" buttons work without any IDs. They test if malicious input is blocked.

2
What You're Testing
We patched code that builds URLs. Attackers could have injected "../" to access wrong endpoints.

3
Expected Results
Attack tests should show BLOCKED. This means the security fix is working.

Security Tests (No Setup Required)
These tests verify that malicious guild IDs are blocked. Click any button - they use test data automatically.

Path Traversal Attack
Simulates an attacker trying to access different API endpoints using "../" in the URL.

Expected Result
BLOCKED - Returns 400 Error
Run Attack Simulation
URL Encoded Traversal
Tests if URL-encoded "../" (%2F%2E%2E) bypasses the security check.

Expected Result
BLOCKED - Returns 400 Error
Run Attack Simulation
Special Characters
Tests if @, #, ?, & characters can be injected into the guild ID.

Expected Result
BLOCKED - Returns 400 Error
Run Attack Simulation
Non-Numeric ID
Tests if alphabetic characters like "abcdefgh" are rejected.

Expected Result
BLOCKED - Returns 400 Error
Run Attack Simulation
Empty Guild ID
Tests what happens when no guild ID is provided.

Expected Result
BLOCKED - Returns Error
Run Attack Simulation
System Health Checks
Verify your backend services are running correctly.

Database Connection
Verifies PostgreSQL database is accessible and queries work.

Expected Result
SUCCESS - Connected
Check Database
Session Status
Confirms your login session is valid and shows your account info.

Expected Result
SUCCESS - Authenticated
Check Session
Bot API Connection
Tests if the Discord bot's internal API is reachable.

Expected Result
SUCCESS - API Responding
Check Bot API
Optional: Test With Real Guild
When Would You Use This?
Only if you want to verify that legitimate requests still work after the security patch. This is optional - the attack tests above are the important ones.

Guild ID (Copy from your dashboard URL or Discord developer mode)
Example: 1234567890123456789
Valid Guild Test
Tests that a real guild ID you have access to works correctly with the security patch.

Expected Result
SUCCESS - If you have access
Test Real Guild
