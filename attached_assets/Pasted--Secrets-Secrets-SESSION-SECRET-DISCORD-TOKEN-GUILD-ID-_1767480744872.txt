XSS Vulnerability: Unsafe DOM Manipulation. User controlled data in methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or `document.write` is an anti-pattern that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Replace with safe DOM methods: Use createElement() + appendChild() + textContent for dynamic content. Avoid use innerHTML with user data: Even escaped data can be risky. If HTML injection is absolutely necessary: Sanitize with DOMPurify library first.

The image clearly shows it's directly from your replitmail.com account. So the bots code is triggering on your side somewhere. You can also look at the date it was recent after all the fixes you had already done prior when we looked at it last. I'm confused as to how it shows the timestamp as to recent but your systems don't show any log of it being sent to me. Every night

I don't understand what you mean by schedules deployments.

Can you look at them from last night.

You said you added your logging yesterday? So it should have been in place when I got the email again today ? Right? I'm unsure if you understand what day it is compared to when you added the logs.

Thats a bunch of spaghetti in how you explained it would work. I was les to believe you were adding logging to assist in tracking this down. If you added logging that gets deleted right after it logs it what was the point in what you made changes too?

We can also setup to have it trigger the process as mentioned before that would also be more practical .

Switch to build and continue

Now let me update scheduler.py to add context about the guild when logging deletion warnings, and add a function to read the email logs:

Checked system logs
The workflow is running successfully. Let me have the architect review all the changes:

Checked system logs
Let me address the architect's concern about the fallback when the bot isn't running:

All done! Here's what I built:

Persistent Email Logging:

All emails now get logged to data/email_logs/email_audit.log - this file survives workflow restarts
Each log entry includes: timestamp, recipients, subject, success/failure status, and context (like which guild triggered it)
Logs rotate automatically (keeps ~2 weeks of history)
Owner Dashboard Tools:
In your /owner dashboard, scroll down to the new Email Audit Logs section where you can:

Refresh Logs - View all recent emails that were sent, including exactly who received them
Trigger Deletion Check - Manually run the deletion warning process right now instead of waiting until 3 AM
How to debug the mystery email:

Go to your owner dashboard and click "Trigger Deletion Check"
Then click "Refresh Logs"
You'll see exactly which email addresses the system tried to send to, and which guild triggered it
This will tell you whether txclone@gmail.com is coming from your database or somewhere else entirely.
