                                                          
  The Discord slash command /setup_demo_roles is not       
  appearing on the demo server (ID: 1419894879894507661)   
  even after bot restart. Please investigate:              
                                                           
  1. CHECK COMMAND DEFINITION (bot.py:5336-5400)           
     - Verify @tree.command decorator is present           
     - Confirm it's not wrapped in any conditional blocks  
     - Check                                               
  @app_commands.default_permissions(administrator=True)    
     - Verify @app_commands.guild_only() is set            
                                                           
  2. CHECK COMMAND SYNC LOGIC (bot.py:4235-4283)           
     - Verify dual sync was added for demo server          
  (1419894879894507661)                                    
     - Confirm DEMO_SERVER_ID constant matches (bot.py:52) 
     - Check if sync is inside try/except that might be    
  failing silently                                         
                                                           
  3. CHECK BOT RUNTIME                                     
     - Run: ps aux | grep "python.*bot.py"                 
     - Check logs: tail -100 nohup.out | grep -E           
  "Synced|demo|setup_demo"                                 
     - Look for error messages during command registration 
                                                           
  4. CHECK DISCORD COMMAND TREE                            
     - In bot.py on_ready, verify command is in tree:      
  tree.get_commands()                                      
     - Check if command count matches expected number      
     - Verify the command isn't being filtered out somehow 
                                                           
  5. POTENTIAL FIXES TO TRY                                
     - Add explicit guild parameter to @tree.command       
  decorator                                                
     - Try tree.copy_global_to(guild=discord.Object(id=DEMO
  _SERVER_ID))                                             
     - Check if command needs to be wrapped in a           
  guild-specific check                                     
                                                           
  Look at the recent commits (82e215d, f01ff54) to see what
   was changed. The command exists in code but Discord     
  isn't seeing it on the demo server.
